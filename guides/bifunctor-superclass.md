# What
The CLC has approved the [proposal #91](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/91), to make Functor a quantified superclass of Bifunctor.
A law now requires that `second = fmap`.

Before:
```haskell
class Bifunctor p where
```

After:
```haskell
class (forall a. Functor (p a)) => Bifunctor p where
```

# When

At the very earliest, the change may appear in GHC 9.6 (~ Q1 2023).

# How

This is a breaking change:

- People can no longer define `Bifunctor` without `Functor`.

However, the breakage is of limited scope.
An impact analysis (please see [comments following here](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/91#issuecomment-1278299233))
showed that only a few of the packages that sucessfully pass dependency resolution on Stackage `nightly-2022-06-17` break with this change.
Patches have been submitted to each of them.

The migration policy for this change is backwards-compatible: you can migrate already and still retain compatibility with existing GHCs.
Because of this, CLC suggests applying patches at your earliest convenience.

### Add any missing Functor instances.

If you defined instance `Bifunctor Foo` but omitted instance `Functor (Foo a)`, you must now define the latter.

You can do this by adding the language pragma `DeriveFunctor` and declaring `derive Functor` at the data type definition.
Alternatively you can explicitely define `fmap`.

In the context of this migration we recommend to define `fmap` canonically, because there could be a `noncanonical-bifunctor-instances` warning in the future. Canonical instances define the subclass in terms of the superclass but not vice versa. Accordingly the definitions `fmap = second` and `fmap = bimap id` are noncanonical. We recommend to avoid them and move any definition of `second` to `fmap` to instead define `second = fmap`:
   ```diff
   + {-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}
   
     data MyType a b = MyLeft a | MyRight b
   -   deriving (Show, Eq)
   +   deriving (Show, Eq, Functor)

     instance Bifunctor MyType where
       first f _ (MyLeft a) = MyLeft (f a)
       first _ _ x          = x
       
   -   second _ f (MyRight b) = MyRight (f b)
   -   second _ _ x          = x
   +   second = fmap
   ```
