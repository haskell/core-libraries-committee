<!--
Thanks for raising a new CLC proposal.

Before proceeding, please make sure that you read and understand [`README.md`](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee#readme) and [`PROPOSALS.md`](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/blob/main/PROPOSALS.md).

This is not a general bug tracker for `base`; it's expected that you not only describe a problem, but also offer a solution, which you are prepared to implement. If you want just to "file-and-forget", raise an issue at https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues.
