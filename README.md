## Contacts

Members of the public are suggested to contact CLC primarily via this issue tracker.
As a secondary medium with more limited visibility one can use a mail list
core-libraries-committee at haskell dot org
([public archives](https://groups.google.com/g/haskell-core-libraries)).

## `base` package

The primary responsibility of CLC is maintenance of `base` package (owned by GHC Team).
See more on the topic in `PROPOSALS.md`.

## Core Libraries

As a collective entity CLC owns, but does not maintain so-called Core Libraries:

* `array`,
* `bytestring`,
* `deepseq`,
* `directory`,
* `filepath`,
* `mtl`,
* `primitive`,
* `process`,
* `random`,
* `stm`,
* `template-haskell`,
* `text`,
* `unix`,
* `vector`,
* `Win32`.

Maintainers of Core Libraries may at their own accord seek CLC approval for
controversial changes, but are not required to do so. CLC does not interfere
with daily development of Core Libraries as long as appointed maintainers
keep them in an appropriate shape and support healthy communication with
contributors. If CLC finds a Core Library in a neglected state, it can
source and install new maintainers or resolve situation by other means.

Libraries that wish CLC to help them with sourcing maintainers
may apply for adoption by CLC.

Core Libraries are different from GHC boot libraries: some boot libraries are not Core
(and as such are maintained either solely by GHC Team, or by third parties), and some
Core Libraries are not required to boot GHC.
